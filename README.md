🏡 Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

This project explores Airbnb data through extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to pricing, availability, locations, and more. The analysis is performed using popular Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.

🌟 Project Overview

Airbnb has transformed the hospitality industry by providing a platform for short-term lodging. This project dives into Airbnb listings data to analyze:

- Pricing dynamics across neighborhoods
- Availability trends
- Popular room types
- Correlations between variables
- Host behaviors and performance

This EDA helps **hosts**, **guests**, and **data analysts** gain valuable insights into Airbnb market trends.
